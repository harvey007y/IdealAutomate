Revision 9 (Version 1.0.4)
**************************

FIX     Fixed potential null reference exception if the
        SelectedItem property is set to null, and no
        tree node is currently selected.
ADD     Added AutoCollapse feature.
CHG     Improved item selection algorithm - the tree is
        no longer recursively traversed, but determines the
        straight path from root parent to the item based
        on the data's parent-child relations.

Revision 7 (Version 1.0.3)
**************************

FIX     ExpandAll didn't expand the root node.
ADD     Added sorting capabilities 
CHG     Style assignment now delegated to virtual ApplyStyle
        method which can easily overridden for node style
        customization.
ADD     Added initial draft of CodeProject tutorial.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Revision 6
**********

ADD     Added ClearCollapsedNodes dependcy property. If
        enabled, the tree will automatically dispose
        invisible tree nodes and recreate them on demand.
        This keeps the memory footprint at a minimum but
        requires subsequent tree node generation.
ADD     Added optional monitoring of expanded nodes through
        the ObserveChildCollections dependency property.
        -> If a child collection that is currently visible
        is being updated, the tree automatically updates itself.
        Still work in progress.
