                If you go to the DOS command prompt and launch IdealAutomate with a parameter of the script name, it will launch IdealAutomate and run that particular script.  This means that we can create a DOS batch file that contains the name of the executable for IdealAutomate followed by a space and then followed by a scriptname in order to create an executable that will run a script. Once we have an executable that can run a script, we can use Windows Task Scheduler to run that executable whenever we want.

                The first step in scheduling a script to run is to create the DOS batch file.  A DOS batch file is just a text file that has the extension of .bat.  To find the name of the executable for IdealAutomate, click on the Windows Start button and click on All Programs.  Find the folder called IdealAutomate.com and open it to find the application Ideal Automate, which has an up arrow to the left of it.  Right-click on the application name, and select properties. Highlight the entire location path and press control-c to copy it.  Open up notepad and type control-v to paste the location you just copied. Add \Ideal Automate.appref-ms to the end of what you just pasted, and surround the entire file name with double quotes. You need double quotes around the file name because DOS does not like spaces in file names. To add the script name as a parameter after the file name, you just put a space after the ending double quote and then type the name of the script.  Here is what my executable filename and scriptname look like for illustration purposes: "C:\Users\Rebecca\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\IdealAutomate.com\Ideal Automate.appref-ms" myScheduledScriptName

                The second step is to save your notepad batch file to your C drive.  For example, you might save your notepad file to C:\scripts\myScheduledScript.bat (Make sure you save it with the .bat extension)

                The third step is to go Windows Start/Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Windows Task Scheduler. Then, under the menu item Actions, you select "Create A Basic Task". Give the task a name; select your trigger; and under Action, select "Start A Program."  In the textbox for the Program/Script, just enter the name of the batch file that you created in step 2.  In my example, the batch file name is C:\scripts\myScheduledScript.bat Do not put the optional argument as we already included the parameter for the scriptname inside the batch file.
