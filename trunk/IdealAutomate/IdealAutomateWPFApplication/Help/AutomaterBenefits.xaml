                        Ideal Automate is based on the reuse of scripts that others have built. The ideal is that one person solves a problem and many can benefit from that solution when it published.

                        Use Windows Snipping Tool to take a snapshot of a part of the screen where you want to click your mouse or type text and save that snapshot into the images folder of your scripts. One of the powerful features of your scripts is that they allow you to find a subimage within the screen as a whole.

                        Write "building block" scripts that you can include in other scripts. You can (synchronously or asychchronously) run any building block script from within a parent script. For example, you can write one basic script that logs you into a web site, and include that "building block" script inside other scripts that are focused on going to different sections of the website.

                        A Script trace is created for each script executed for debugging purposes. The script trace tells you each line that was executed and provides pictures of what the screen looked like at the moment that there was an attempt to find an image.
