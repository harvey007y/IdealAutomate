                SqlCmds are used to store and retrieve information in a Sql Server database.  The Name of the SQL Cmd is how you refer to the command in your script.  The command consists of  five additional columns.  The ConnectionString points to a primitive string that connects your script to the sql database. The SqlCommand points to a primitive string that contains the actual sql statement or the name of a stored procedure.  The CommandType is a dropdownlist that allows you to choose whether the SqlCommand points to a Sql Statement (Text) or a stored procedure (Stored Procedure). The SqlResult is only used for Select Statements that return more than a single column of information. The SqlResult points to a two-dimensional array that will hold the results returned from the Sql Select Statements. ReturnCode indicates if the sql command ran okay.  If it did run okay, ReturnCode will contain the number of rows that were returned or updated. If it did not run okay, the ReturnCode will be a negative number. Here are the columns involved in SQLCmds:
