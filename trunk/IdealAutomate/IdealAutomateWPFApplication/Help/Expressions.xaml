                Expressions are usually used to make calculations.  For example, if you have a primitive integer that you want to increment, you can do it by creating an expression and setting the primitive to that expression. Lets say you have a counter called intCounter.  You can increase that counter by creating an expression called Add1ToCounter that is has intCounter as Entity1 and + as the relationship and a primitive with a value of 1 as Entity2. The action in the script to increment the counter would be Set intCounter = expIncrementCounter. Here are the columns involved in expressions:

                    <Bold>
                        1. Name
                    </Bold>
                </Italic>
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Name is the name that will be used by the script to refer to the expression.

                <Italic>
                    <Bold>
                2. Entity1
                    </Bold>
                </Italic>
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Entity1 refers to a primitive (almost always an integer).
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph FontSize="14pt" >
                <Italic>
                    <Bold>
                        3. Relationship
                    </Bold>
                </Italic>
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Relationship specifies the operation that needs to be applied to the two entities involved in the expression.
