                        If your script is not executing correctly, you can cancel it by hitting the Pause button on your keyboard.

                        Do not give up. Scripts are not easy to write, and they are very "brittle" in that they break easily whenever anything changes; but they can also be a very powerful tool. When a script is first written it will often have problems at first due to unanticipated steps needed during execution. However, as the script is executed over and over again, you eventually remove all of the bugs in the script so that it almost becomes bullet proof.

                        Finding an image is much more brittle than using keyboard shortcuts so always use the find image approach as the last resort.

                        If using dual monitors, IdealAutomate only uses your primary screen for taking images of the screen so you need to have drag any windows you will be using over to the primary monitor and either close or minimize them so that when they reopen, they will reopen on the primary monitor.

                        After downloading a public script, you may have to update the images involved in the script by replacing the images in the debug\images tab with new images that you create on your local machine. This is because the resolution, background, etc. on your local machine may be different from the machine that the images were originally created from.

                        When attempting to identify when a page has loaded, a quick and dirty approach is to just use the sleep verb, but a much more accurate method to determine when the page has loaded is to try to find an image on the newly loaded page. If you are just going to use the script a few times, using the sleep verb to wait for the page works fine; however, if the script is going to be executed over and over, identifying the page loaded event by finding an image on the page is best.

                        When launching an application, it is much easier and 100% more reliable to use the IdealAutomateCore Run method as opposed to trying to launch it by clicking on an icon image.

                        The visual basic SendKeys function is used to mimic pressing special keys (like the enter or alt keys). This means you need to use the help file or google in order to learn what characters can be used to represent special keys.  For example, the ^ character is used to represent the control key and here is how you indicate the enter key is pressed: {ENTER}.  You will also need to learn how to "escape" special characters (like the bracket character).  If you are trying to type a lot of special characters, it may be easier to create a string primitive with the text you want to type and use the PutEntityInClipboard verb to copy the string into the clipboard. After the string is in the clipboard, you can use the TypeText verb with control v to paste what is in the clipboard to where you want it.

                        Alt-Space-n is shortcut for minimizing active window - you almost always do this at the beginning of every script in order to minimize the Ideal Automate window.

                        Before writing a complicated script, you can use the MessageBox verb for each step to create a wizard that outlines the general steps that you want to automate. You can replace each MessageBox with the logic needed to perform that step when you feel comfortable getting to that level of detail.

                        Finding images in the taskbar and the active window border can be problematic because of transparency settings for those areas.  It helps to use the control panel to turn off transparency (Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Personalization\Window Color and Appearance - uncheck enable transparency) and to set the background for your desktop to a solid color.

                        When sending text to the screen, you always need to allow some time for the text to be sent so it is a good practice to specify 500 milliseconds of wait time in entity2 when using the TypeText verb.

                        If you cannot figure out why a script is not working, you can just use the debugger in visual studio. Alternatively, you can view a log file at c:\Data\IdealAutomateLog.txt to see what IdealAutomateCore methods executed.

                        If you cannot figure out why an image is not being found, go to the bin\debug\images folder in Windows Explorer and you can see the big image and small image that are being used in the search.

                        There is a trick to using Windows Snipping Tool to take snapshots of dropdownlists and popup windows. The trick involves clicking on the new option in the snipping tool to cause it to make the entire screen go out of focus. Then, you hit the escape key to remove opacity cloud that prevents you from accessing your screen. At this point, you can activate your popup or dropdown window. Next, you press the control key plus the print key to cause the opacity cloud to appear without removing the popup or dropdown window. You can now drag the Windows Snipping Tool around the window to get a snapshot of it without it disappearing.

                         You can easily copy the path to any executable running on your computer by following these steps: First, go to Description tab and click the button at the bottom of the description tab called "Copy Executable Path Into Executable Textbox By Clicking on a Running Application". Third, click anywhere on the application running on your computer for which you want to get the path.
